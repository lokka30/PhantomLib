- Addition | Thanks to SpigotMC users Sullivan_Bognar and imDaniX for providing their code - 1.16 hex color translation has been added to the MessageMethods class. This means that all resources which use PhantomLib (e.g. LevelledMobs and PAPIChatFormatter) AND servers that also run 1.16+ will be able to utilise these codes. For example, in PAPIChatFormatter, you can now use hex color codes in your chat format.
